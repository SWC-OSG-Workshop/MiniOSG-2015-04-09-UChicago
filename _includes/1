Before the workshop, please attempt the setup instructions at  http://swc-osg-workshop.github.io/2015-03-03-iupui/setup.html to make sure you are ready to go.  These should be straightforward, but if you hit any snags we're happy to help. Please send any questions to us or drop by the workshop a bit earlier so that we can troubleshoot then.

We look forward to seeing you at 8:30 am on December 15 in Room 240, Searle Chemistry Laboratory, 5735 S. Ellis Ave.  If you are unable to join us, please let us know as we will make the the spot available for those on the waiting list.

Please bring an extended power cord so that it will be easy to plug in  the electrical outlets on floor. 

Thank you
